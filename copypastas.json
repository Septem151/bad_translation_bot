    "nobody cares about someone with a quick inferno cape. It has no use, no idea why %USERNAME% even made this post. Fire cape sure, that requires skill, but this doesn't.",
    "Cheese capers should learn to stop back talking infernals or higher. If someone with a cheese cape has an opinion that differs from an infernal's, the cheese caper should NOT try to reason with the infernal. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the infernal says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a cheese caper backtalk an infernal, and it's disgusting, because the cheese caper is wrong most of the time. The only time a cheese caper is right is when 2,148,000,000 cheese capers are talking back to a single infernal. There's a reason why you're stuck in your cheese cape. It's because you think different than the infernals. Start thinking like an infernal.",

    "Look this cape came out over a year ago now and it was fun to watch the pvm pros go for it, however its time to make another way for players to get the cape. There is definitely many maxed people who don't have the skill or top tile gear for this like myself. Being able to prayer flick well and stay focused is very impressive however that's out of my capabilities. One of my ideas were TzHaar creatures could have a rare drop of the Infernal cape for maxed players only or an elite diary requirement. The high scores could have a kill count to show if you completed it or got from a drop. I would like to hear what people think about this.",
    "Hello my beautiful goddess,\nI saw your accomplishment and figured id try writing you. i can't disrespect a girl. It's not in me. I'm a gentleman. Quite honestly, It sure surprised me to see you on here. I just have a hard time seeing someone who could easilly be a model having an inferno cape. Im not trying to give you a line, you really are astoundingly beautiful to me. It would be a pleasure and a priviledge getting to know you. I'd love to find out if you are as beautiful inside as you are out.\nHope to hear from you soon, %USERNAME% *tips fedora* OwO",

    "I am at peace in the inferno. I am aware of every passing game tick. The only thing standing between myself and the infernal cape is my mindset and 69 waves of grueling punishment.\n**FUCK** bats.",

    "According to world population studies, approximately 108 billion people have lived on this planet. Assuming that the average lifespan of all these people was 25, there has been around 2.7 trillion years of life, if we multiply this by the number of days in a year (365), there is a total of 985,500,000,000,000 days of life (985.5 trillion days). Not once in any of those days did anybody ask.",
