If someone with a cheese cape has an opinion that differs from an infernal's, the cheese caper should NOT try to reason with the infernal. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the infernal says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a cheese caper backtalk an infernal, and it's disgusting, because the cheese caper is wrong most of the time. The only time a cheese caper is right is when 2,148,000,000 cheese capers are talking back to a single infernal. There's a reason why you're stuck in your cheese cape. It's because you think different than the infernals. Start thinking like an infernal."

There is definitely many maxed people who don't have the skill or top tile gear for this like myself. Being able to prayer flick well and stay focused is very impressive however that's out of my capabilities. One of my ideas were TzHaar creatures could have a rare drop of the Infernal cape for maxed players only or an elite diary requirement. The high scores could have a kill count to show if you completed it or got from a drop. I would like to hear what people think about this."

Quite honestly, It sure surprised me to see you on here. I just have a hard time seeing someone who could easilly be a model having an inferno cape. Im not trying to give you a line, you really are astoundingly beautiful to me. It would be a pleasure and a priviledge getting to know you. I'd love to find out if you are as beautiful inside as you are out.\nHope to hear from you soon. Love, %USERNAME% *tips fedora* OwO"

The infernal cape is the expected cape if you are not a total noob in 2022."
